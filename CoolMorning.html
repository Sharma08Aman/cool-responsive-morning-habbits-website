              <p class="msgcnt2"> 
                Coffee is an effective means of jolting your brain to a rush of energy. However, milk produces lactic acid within our body that induces sleep so drinking a goodnight milk is a great habbit. But you can sense the dillema now of adding milk to your coffee for early morning. It reduces the jolt of coffee. Thus, about 100ml to 150ml of early morning black coffee can wake you up instantly.
